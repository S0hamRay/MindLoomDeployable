# Loom

Loom builds a searchable company knowledge base from organization directories,
documents, conversations, connected workspace apps, desktop activity summaries,
and user-approved browser captures.

## Repository layout

```text
apps/
├── web/                 # Main React + TypeScript user interface
├── api/                 # Main Python API and all server-side processing
├── desktop-agent/       # macOS Accessibility capture agent (menu bar)
└── browser-extension/   # Chrome extension for approved work captures
docker-compose.yml       # Complete local stack
test_api.py              # Small manual API smoke test
```

There is intentionally one frontend and one backend:

- `apps/web` owns everything a user sees.
- `apps/api` owns authentication, organizations, ingestion, AI search, connected
  apps, embeddings, screenshot capture, and desktop activity session processing.
- `apps/desktop-agent` is a macOS client that uploads on-device task summaries only.
- `apps/browser-extension` is a client of the main API; it is not a separate
  backend.

## How data flows

```text
React app / desktop agent / browser extension / connected apps
                       |
                       v
                Loom Python API
                       |
                    Redis queue
                       |
                 ingestion worker
                 /             \
                v               v
     PostgreSQL + pgvector     Neo4j
     jobs, text and search     relationships
```

The macOS desktop agent captures Accessibility interaction events from an
explicit app allowlist, aggregates them on-device into task summaries, and
uploads only those summaries (`POST /captures/activity-sessions`). Skill Files
are drafted from aggregates (no pixels). See [`apps/desktop-agent/README.md`](apps/desktop-agent/README.md).

Browser screenshots are still supported: captured locally, shown for approval,
and uploaded only after approval. The API stores image bytes in blob storage
(local volume by default; set `BLOB_STORAGE_BACKEND=s3` for multi-replica) and
capture metadata in Postgres, then creates vision summaries in the background.

Manual document ingestion supports PDF, Word (`.docx`), PowerPoint (`.pptx`),
Excel (`.xlsx`), CSV, text, Markdown, JSONL, and operational logs. Connector and
manual documents use the same provenance model for ownership, dates, location,
version, contributors, permissions, and source links.

## Run the full stack

1. Copy the API environment template:

   ```bash
   cp apps/api/.env.example .env
   ```

2. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `NEO4J_PASSWORD` in `.env`. For Google sign-in and
   workspace connections, set `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` (and
   authorize your web origin for GIS). Also set `SESSION_SECRET` for production.
   Local docker defaults: `APP_ENV=development`, `ALLOW_DEV_INTEGRATIONS=true`.
   Production also requires strong webhook secrets, `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
   `GOOGLE_PUBSUB_PUSH_AUDIENCE`, and a non-default `MICROSOFT_GRAPH_CLIENT_STATE`.
   CORS is limited to `FRONTEND_URL` plus `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. Set
   `FRONTEND_URL` to the public web origin and register OAuth redirect URIs on
   the public API host. For the Compose frontend, bake `VITE_API_BASE` (default
   `/api` via nginx proxy) and `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` at image build — rebuild
   to change. See [`apps/web/README.md`](apps/web/README.md) for the HTTPS
   deploy checklist, and [`docs/STAGING_SMOKE.md`](docs/STAGING_SMOKE.md) before
   a beta cut.

3. Start everything:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

4. Open:

   - Web app: <http://localhost:5500>
   - API docs: <http://localhost:8000/docs>
   - Neo4j browser: <http://localhost:7474>

## Run applications directly

Web:

```bash
cd apps/web
cp .env.example .env.local   # set VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID to match GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
npm install
npm run dev
```

API:

```bash
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload

# In a second terminal:
python -m worker
```

Desktop capture agent (macOS):

```bash
cd apps/desktop-agent
swift run MindLoomAgent
```

See [`apps/desktop-agent/README.md`](apps/desktop-agent/README.md) for Accessibility
permission, allowlist setup, the Skill File smoke path, and publishing a website
download (`/download` after `./scripts/package-app.sh` + frontend rebuild).

Tests:

```bash
cd apps/api
pytest
```

## Naming and generated data

The product and all user-facing text use the name **Loom**. Runtime screenshots,
summaries, uploaded blobs, build output, credentials, and local dependencies are
ignored by Git. Only anonymized fixtures should be committed.
