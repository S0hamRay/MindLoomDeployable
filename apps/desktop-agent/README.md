# MindLoom Desktop Capture Agent (macOS)

Privacy-focused menu-bar agent that captures **structured Accessibility interaction events** from an explicit app allowlist, aggregates them on-device into task summaries, and uploads only those aggregates to the Loom API. Raw events stay on the device; no screenshots or keystroke content are transmitted.

## Privacy defaults

- Empty allowlist → structurally nothing is captured
- Non-allowlisted apps never attach AX observers
- Password / secure fields are redacted at capture time
- Text field values (`AXValue`) are never read
- Only task summaries leave the device

## Requirements

- macOS 13+
- Swift 5.9+ / Xcode Command Line Tools (or Xcode)
- Loom API running (e.g. `docker compose up` → `http://localhost:8000`)
- Accessibility permission for the **packaged** `MindLoomAgent.app` (not a raw `swift run` binary)

### Accessibility (important)

macOS ties Accessibility to a specific app identity. After every rebuild:

1. `./scripts/package-app.sh`
2. `open dist/MindLoomAgent.app`
3. System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → enable **Loom Capture**
4. **Quit the agent completely and reopen it** (permission does not apply to the already-running process)

If it still says permission isn’t granted, remove old `MindLoomAgent` / `Loom Capture` rows, add `dist/MindLoomAgent.app` with +, enable, quit, reopen.

## Build & run

```bash
cd apps/desktop-agent
swift run MindLoomAgent
```

Or package and launch as a real macOS app (recommended — survives closing the terminal):

```bash
cd apps/desktop-agent
chmod +x scripts/package-app.sh
./scripts/package-app.sh
open dist/MindLoomAgent.app
```

A **Loom Capture** control window should open. Use that window for Start / Pause /
Allowlist / Upload. A menu-bar item is also registered, but your menu bar may be
too full for it to appear.

If you only ran `swift build`, that compiles and exits — it does not launch the agent.

## Configuration

On first launch the agent writes `~/.mindloom/agent.json`:

```json
{
  "apiBase": "http://localhost:8000",
  "webBase": "http://localhost:5500",
  "orgId": "default",
  "userId": "desktop-user",
  "accessToken": "",
  "email": "",
  "allowlist": [],
  "idleGapSeconds": 90
}
```

### Sign in (required for upload)

1. Start the Loom web app (Compose `:5500` or Vite `:5173` — set `webBase` to match).
2. In the **Loom Capture** window, click **Sign in with Google**.
3. Your browser opens `/desktop-auth`; finish Google sign-in (or reuse an existing web session).
4. The page sends the Loom JWT back to the agent over `127.0.0.1`; the token is saved in `agent.json`.

You should not need to copy tokens from DevTools. Use **Sign out** to clear the saved session.

`apiBase` is the Loom API the agent uploads to. `webBase` is only for the browser sign-in page.

- **Add Frontmost App to Allowlist** — grant capture for the active app
- **Remove** an allowlisted app
- **Open Config File…** / **Reload Config**
- **Grant Accessibility Permission…** if needed

Local raw events (debug / retention) are appended under `~/.mindloom/events/` and are **not** uploaded.

## Capture workflow

1. Grant Accessibility when prompted (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility).
2. Add the apps you want captured to the allowlist.
3. **Start Session** — status shows Capturing (or Paused / Needs Accessibility).
4. Work in allowlisted apps. Use **Pause Capture** anytime (user-controlled, independent of admin).
5. When done, choose either:
   - **End & Upload Summary** → `POST /captures/activity-sessions`
   - **End, Upload & Create Skill File** → upload + `POST /captures/activity-sessions/{id}/analyze`
6. Review the proposed Skill File in the web app **Workflows** tab (source badge: **Desktop**).
7. Approve to ingest into the knowledge graph (same path as browser skills).

## Smoke test

1. Start the stack: `docker compose up --build` from the repo root.
2. Run the agent; click **Sign in with Google** and finish in the browser.
3. Add **Notes** (or another app) to the allowlist.
4. Start a session, create/edit a note for ~30s, then **End, Upload & Create Skill File**.
5. Open <http://localhost:5500> → Workflows → confirm a **Desktop** skill draft.
6. Approve it; confirm it becomes searchable via Ask / appears as a `skill_file` document.

## API contract (agent → API)

`POST /captures/activity-sessions`

```json
{
  "sessionId": "session-…",
  "orgId": "default",
  "userId": "desktop-user",
  "source": "desktop_ax",
  "startedAt": "2026-08-02T12:00:00Z",
  "endedAt": "2026-08-02T12:05:00Z",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "taskId": "…",
      "startedAt": "…",
      "endedAt": "…",
      "primaryApp": "Notes",
      "apps": ["Notes"],
      "stepHints": ["Focus Notes", "Click New Note"],
      "fieldInteractions": [
        { "role": "AXTextArea", "label": "Note body", "durationMs": 1200 }
      ],
      "stats": { "eventCount": 4, "activeMs": 300000 }
    }
  ],
  "note": ""
}
```

`POST /captures/activity-sessions/{sessionId}/analyze` drafts a Skill File from those summaries (text-only LLM; no vision).
